# Langchain v1: A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) App 
Langchain is a powerful source to building applications anabled by LLM models to create chatbots. It has extensive documentation. One interesting piece is the [Build a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) APP](https://python.langchain.com/docs/tutorials/rag/). While the subject of RAG is interesting, the tutorial is written in the outdated Langchain v0.3. This project will rewrite the code in the tutorial to, instead, use Langchain v1.

The main objectives of this repository is to:
1. Update the code in the Langchain RAG tutorial to use Langchain v1
2. Personal learning experience in using RAG (which I at the beginning of this projects have mainly theoretical experience with)
